# iniRun
A nice and easy implementation of ShellExecuteA API in Visual-Basic 6, implemented so the program arguments are read from INI file in the same name as the exe file (its created automatically). I've created this one so I would never need to mess-with inverted-commas pairs and escaping them in a mix from HELL (both \" and \'). I use it a lot, its faster then running programs in any other way - plus, it created the program with no parent-process. I use it with Chromium running many (many!) switches, way pass the limit of desktop-shortcut and far-easier the CMD script!!!
